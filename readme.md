This repository gathers all the notes that I am taking for the PCEP, PCAP and PCPP exams. The notes are intended to help **programmers with knowledge** to pass the certifications. Thas is, the notes highlights the most relevant concept and aspects of python without verbosity. Besides, the practice exam questions and code snippets focus on tips for the exam.

## üìå **What‚Äôs Inside?**  
- **Exam-Focused Notes**: No verbosity, just key concepts for PCEP/PCAP (variables, loops, OOP, etc.).  
- **Practice Questions**: Mock exams covering the study notes with collapsible solutions to practice.  
- **Structured Learning**: Organized by certification level (`/PCEP`, `/PCAP`, `/PCPP`).  
- **Pro Tips**: Highlighted "Exam Traps" to avoid mistakes.

## üí° **Sample Practice Exam Questions**
The folder `Practice_Exam_Questions` contains question to practice with the solution hidden like the following one:

1. What is the expected output?  
   ```python  
   print(4 / 2)  
   print(type(4 // 2.0))  
   ```  
   <details>
   <summary>üìù Click to reveal solution</summary>  

   **Output**:  
   ```python
   2.0  
   <class 'float'>  
   ```  
   **Explanation**:  
   - `4 / 2` returns a float (`2.0`).  
   - `4 // 2.0` uses float division ‚Üí result is `2.0` (float).  
   </details>
